[Example] Small Datacenter Fabric network

Example to test Routing/Forwarding policies that profits from DC topology knowledge

3 Configurations:
- SimpleTable : Base configuration with common distance vector and forwarding table
- DCForwarding : Test configuration for topological DC Forwarding
- MDCRouting : Test configuration for topological DC Forwarding + Routing

In order to test the correctness of policies, random shim flows are deallocated and finally each node sends a pdu to every other node in the network.
